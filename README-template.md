## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about flexbox and media queries when designing the mobile and desktop views of this project. I also explored more about the css element "object-fit" and how it works!

### Continued development

In the future I would work on more projects with a mobile-first workflow compared to desktop-first to see if that would be more effective. I also will work on more practice with flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure I can fully comprehend these concepts.
